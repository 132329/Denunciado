# Denuncia.do

This project born from the need from people to have a way of communication between municipalities and communities.

Some municipalities, have their platforms, but they are complex to validate the veracity of complaints.

Denounced, it was born with the purpose of offering a free platform to these municipalities.

Denounced consists of three main modules developed with Microsoft technologies, using the .Net Framework and Xamarin for its development:

1. Back End Web Project:

Module of administration of the complaints, by the employees of the town councils.

In this tool, the employees of the city council receive, validate, report and close the complaints, after being served.

2. Web Portal Client:

It consists of a web project, so that the community make their complaints, in the same, the users of the service create a profile, must specify when making their complaint, evidence to support this.

Through the portal, they can see the complaints of other community members, follow it, give their opinion or provide possible solutions or more evidence.

3. Mobile Project:

It has the same functionalities as the web portal, with the addition, that the automatic location can be sent, from the cell phone.
